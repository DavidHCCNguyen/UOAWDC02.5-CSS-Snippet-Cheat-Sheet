# 02 Mini-Project: CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

## Instructed Notes

* As a user, I can view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.

* As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.

* As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.

* As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.

### Criteria

* Must use semantic HTML elements and proper indentation.

* Use CSS variables to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme.

* Use flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid layout.

* Each CSS snippet should have a card-like layout with the CSS syntax wrapped in an CSS transition property.

* Each CSS snippet can easily be highlighted for copying on click using the CSS linear-gradient function.

* Must incorporate a background color using a CSS user-select property.

* Must incorporate a bit of animation using the HTML pre element.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

* The HTML `<pre>` element is very literal about spaces and indentation. To gain a better understanding of how to work with it, check out this article on [considerations for styling the pre tag](https://css-tricks.com/considerations-styling-pre-tag/).
